1) Create a Start Button and a Stop Button
2) Use Moment.JS to determine the number of minutes between when the Start Button is pressed and when the Stop Button is pressed
3) Use chart.js to make a line graph to compare the number of minutes coded day to day (use firebase to log this)
4) Develop a streak function that resets of coding is not done on a particular day
5) Have the ability to log what project the programmer is working on, to open a new project, or close a project when it's completed
